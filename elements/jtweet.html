            <h1>Changing the Database and Styling</h1>
            <h4>3/02/2015</h4>

            </br>
            <h3>Changing to Realm</h3>
            <p> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When implementing a SQLite database into JTweet I also though it was clunky.  RecyclerViews were designed to take in lists of data, not cursors.  When I kept getting unique idea errors I knew there had to be a batter way to cashes the timeline data.  I searched around and found Realm a mobile data basing software.  It is exactly what I was looking for, it stores the data in the data base and the queries of the database return a list of objects, so it would pair very well for with the RecyclerView. I gutted the code and not JTweet runs smoother than ever without any of the unique id errors.   </br> 
            </p>
            <h3>Minor Styling Changes</h3>
            <p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After adding this data I wanted to work a little on styling.  I found a gist of code that transforms Picasso images to circles so the profile images would look a lot nicer.  I also added a profile card to display the user information of the profile that you are viewing.  It is very basic, but getting it to load at the top of the RecyclerView took a little bit of time to implement.</br>
            </p>
            <div class="double-img">
                <img src="../Media/JTweet/newtimeline.png" style="height: 40%; width: 40%; margin-right:10px">     
                <img src="../Media/JTweet/newprofile.png" style="height: 40%; width: 40%;">
            </div>
            <p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also used this method to include the current users profile image and banner in the navigation drawer. </br>
            </p>
            <div class="img-post">
                <img class="image-test" src="../Media/JTweet/nav.png" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;">
            </div>
            <p> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that all the timeline errors are fixed I feel like the timeline is functional enough to start working on other features that are need for this to be a fully functional app.</br>

            <h1>Initial Progress</h1>
            <h4>2/16/2015</h4>

            </br>
            <h3>Main Timeline Setup</h3>
            <p> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This winter break I decided to teach myself Android Development to apply the knowledge of Java that I have gained from my first year at RIT.  I have already dabbled in Android Development when I made my first app SimpleCalc.  While it worked for the most part I wanted to learn the proper structure and techniques it takes to make a fully featured Android application.  In order to accomplish this I completed the Android Fundamentals tutorial on Udacity to learn about Activities, Fragments, Services, and more.  After I completed this I wanted to make my first fully featured Android application. My idea for a project came when I received a invitation to test out Twitters new Fabric API that allowed developers to integrate Twitter data into their applications with little effort.  So with this in mind, I decided I wanted to make a Twitter application that implemented Google’s new Material design specifications. </br> 
            </p>
            <p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing I had to do was learn how to use the new RecyclerView so the application could display a list of tweets.  The Udacity tutorial had me use a ListView with a custom adapter, so the change was not too difficult.  Once I got the RecyclerView working I populated it with CardView objects that could hold the most of the necessary Twitter data.  Then once I setup fabric and figured out how to pull the data I needed I had a very basic Twitter app that could display a tweet’s text and the username of the person who had tweeted it.</br>
            <p>
            <div class="img-post">
                <img class="image-test" src="../Media/JTweet/text-based.png" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;">
            </div>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The next step was to add the additional information and add a basic style.  So I had to add an image for the profile picture format the header of the tweet to include the name and username of the user.  I had a little trouble loading pictures into the RecyclerView. They would load but would stutter and overlap when scrolling.  I did some research and found out that Android has a hard time rendering images quickly and efficiently and about everyone recommended using custom libraries to accomplish smooth image integration.  I tried a bunch of different libraries and I ended up using Picasso for its ease of use and I liked how smoothly the images loaded when scrolling.</br>
            <p>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Up until this point all of the Tweet data had been loading directly from the network. While this is quick and easy, applications should not being using that much data and why reload data that has already been downloaded.  To solve this I created a SQLite database to store all the Tweet Data. It held the data for the username, name, tweet text, time posted, url of profile image.  I then had to go back to the Adapter I had made for the RecyclerView and alter it to not accept an Array of tweets but a Cursor to access the database.  Once I got that working the app ran much more smoothly and used a lot less data.  Once I setup the timeline I also implemented a service to update the tweets in the timeline in the background, every 5 minutes. </br>
            <p>
            <div class="img-post">
                <img src="../Media/JTweet/links.png" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;">
            </div>
            <h3>Creating the Profile Activity</h3>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            After I completed this I was happy where the timeline was but I wanted to be able to view the profiles of the people who tweeted.  I created another Activity that contained another RecyclerView to hold the selected profile’s tweets. I decided that I did not want to store that data in a database so I had to create an Adapter to load data directly from the Twitters servers.  Once I had that created I added a navigation drawer that contained a button to get to the your own profile.  Once I knew that worked. I went to getting creating clickable strings in the Tweet text as links to profiles.  I created a class to find spans with and ‘@’ or ‘#’ symbol. The ‘@’ being the symbol for tagging another user in a tweet and the ‘#’ to symbolize a hashtag.  I created class then to changed the color of the text and made it clickable.  But now I was presented with a problem where I could find profile strings and make them clickable, but I had no way to switch profiles.  To solve this I created a interface to have a swapProfile method that the main Timeline Fragment then implemented.  In this method I would make a new Intent with the required data for the profile (The ID of the profile trying to be accessed) and then start the profile activity.</br>
            <p>
            <h3>Back to the Timeline</h3>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Now that I had profiles working I wanted to bring my attention back to the timeline.  When browsing the API for tweet objects, I found that they contain a entities attribute which has a media attribute.  This media attribute would hold the urls of the media attached to this post and in the case of what I was looking for was the image attached to the tweet.  I added an ImageView to my post and quickly had a timeline full of embedded images in tweets.  The only problem I had was that the Images were all different sizes and I felt like it made the timeline look cluttered.  OS I found on the Android documentation a animation that would zoom and image from a clickable thumbnail. After some styling tricks I got it to work and had clickable thumbnails that would zoom and un-zoom upon click.
            </br>
            <p>

            <div class="double-img">
                <img src="../Media/JTweet/thumb-nail.png" style="height: 40%; width: 40%; margin-right:10px">     
                <img src="../Media/JTweet/zoomzoomzoom.png" style="height: 40%; width: 40%;">
            </div>

            <h3>Tweet Details</h3>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The next feature that needed to be added was a retweet, favorite, and reply button.  I initially added these buttons to the bottom of each tweet in the main timeline, but it made the timeline too cluttered.  To solve this I made a tweet activity that would be started to display a tweet in a CardView that contained the tweet and the buttons needed to implement all those features.  A method was added to the profileSwitch interface to have a swapToTweet method.  This method would be called whenever the user clicked text of a tweet.  From this I was able to then 
            easily manipulate the Twitter API to allow the user to retweet and favorite the
            current tweet.
            </br>
            <p>
            <div class="triple-img">
                <img src="../Media/JTweet/plain-tweet.png" style="height: 30%; width: 30%; margin-right:10px">
                <img src="../Media/JTweet/favorite.png" style="height: 30%; width: 30%; margin-right:10px">         
                <img src="../Media/JTweet/re-tweet.png" style="height: 30%; width: 30%;">

            </div>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Next, a lot of tweets are conversations between users, so a thread view would be useful for a lot of users.  The problem is that the Twitter REST API does not give access to replies to a given tweet.  That is something I am going to revisit at another time. In the meantime it does give you the tweet that the current tweet is in reply to so by going up through the tweets in the conversation you can create a thread of tweets leading up until the initial tweet.

            </div>

            <h3>Composing a Tweet</h3>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
           It took me a long time to such a main feature because I was not sure how to implement it.  I knew for the tweet composition, I wanted a floating action button that would create a floating window that would hover over the timeline. As I looked up how to implement a FAB (Floating action button) I found a library that had an easy to use interface that allows the button to be attached to a RecyclerView to appear and disappear while scrolling.  
            </br>
            <p>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
           Once I had that working the next step was to figure out how to create a window.  After hours of research I found an example online on how to create a floating window.  I modified this example to have a edit text field and button to send the tweet.  I then hooked it up with Fabric and it worked flawlessly.  It was a little rough looking, but I can always style it later.

            <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
           Now with classes starting up again my progress as slowed but these are the features I have planned for the upcoming weeks.
